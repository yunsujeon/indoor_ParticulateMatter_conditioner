# indoor_ParticulateMatter_conditioner_system
### What is this?
#### This is a kind of air purify system.
When we purify indoor air by using purifier, we use much energy.

#### So many route to save energy.
-> For example, open windows instead of turn on air conditioner.

#### Health care is as important as save energy.
-> When the fine dust(particulate matter) level is high, we must turn on air purifier and close windows.

#### Considering state of windows, purifier, temperature, level of particulate matter (indoor, outdoor) we made a indoor particulate matter conditioner system.
